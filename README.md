# Visibility Graph Metrics for Estimating HRV Features
This repository holds my workspace for exploring the ability of several visibility graph metrics to estimate heart-rate-variability features and measures.

This work is done as part of a student research assistant position at the Robust Data Science Group at Technical University of Darmstadt.
